## Pneumonia Detection Using CNN based Feature Extraction
## Introduction
- Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening, especially in young children and the elderly. Chest X-rays are the most common method for diagnosing pneumonia, but they can be difficult to interpret, even for experienced radiologists.

- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning algorithm that have been shown to be very effective at image classification tasks. CNNs can be used to extract features from chest X-rays that are indicative of pneumonia. These features can then be used to train a classifier that can accurately diagnose pneumonia.

The process of using CNNs for pneumonia detection can be divided into three stages:

- Preprocessing: The chest X-rays are first preprocessed to remove noise and artifacts. This is done to ensure that the CNN is not trained on irrelevant features.
- Feature extraction: The CNN is then used to extract features from the preprocessed chest X-rays. These features are typically the activations of the CNN's hidden layers.
- Classification: The extracted features are then used to train a classifier that can distinguish between normal and pneumonia-affected chest X-rays.
The use of CNNs for pneumonia detection has several advantages. First, CNNs are able to learn complex features from chest X-rays that are not easily visible to the human eye. Second, CNNs are able to be trained on large datasets of chest X-rays, which can improve their accuracy. Third, CNNs can be used to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia, which can free up radiologists to focus on more complex cases.

- There are a number of challenges that need to be addressed before CNNs can be widely used for pneumonia detection. One challenge is the need for large datasets of chest X-rays with ground truth labels. Another challenge is the need to develop CNN architectures that are robust to variations in image quality.

Despite these challenges, the use of CNNs for pneumonia detection is a promising area of research. With further development, CNNs could become a valuable tool for early diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia.
