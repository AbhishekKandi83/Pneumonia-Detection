Pneumonia Detection using CNN with Implementation in Python


Introduction
Hey there! Just finished another deep learning project several hours ago, now I want to share what I actually did there. 
So the objective of this challenge is to determine whether a person suffers pneumonia or not. 
If yes, then determine whether itâ€™s caused by bacteria or viruses. Well, I think this project should be called classification instead of detection.
